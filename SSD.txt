The GUI is just one window described in GUI.fxml.
The controller class or it is in GUIController.java

The GUI has 4 buttons and a list.

One of the buttons will open a file chooser, if a valid file then the file is parsed using the Word and WordCountTree class, the number of each word is then output into the list.
The other three buttons sort the list, and a second click on any will reverse sort.

The parsing is done by parsing all the file into words, then constructing a tree with each word and then recursivly reading through the tree to see the number of each word there has been.
