Word counter.

This program is able to read a file and tell you how many times each word occurs in it.
It can be sorted and reverse sorted by number of occurrences, length of word, or alphabetically.

The "Parse File" button will open a file chooser window.
Navigate to the folder the file you want to read is in, select it, and click open.

Clicking the "alphabetical" button will sort the words alphabetically.
Clicking the "word length" button will sort the words by length.
Clicking the "occurrences" button will sort the words by occurrences in the document.

Clicking any of these buttons twice, without clicking another button in between will do the reverse sort.

Each of these sorts are stable sorts.
That means that if you click "alphabetical", followed by "word length", then any words that are of the same length are going to be alphabetically sorted still.
